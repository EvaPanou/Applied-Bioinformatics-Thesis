# Purpose of this folder

This folder will contain external data (from other research papers) that I might need to use in order to compare my results with them, to see if they align with the existing literature. 

For now I only have some Gene lists, that contain the genes that are important to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. 
Below, I will explain in detail what this data is and where it is from.
