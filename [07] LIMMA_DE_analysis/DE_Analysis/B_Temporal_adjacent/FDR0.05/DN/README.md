# Folder: `B_Temporal_adjacent/FDR0.05/DOWN/`

### Downregulated genes within each condition at **FDR < 0.05** and **logFC < -1**

This folder contains the **expanded set of downregulated genes** (twofold or greater decreases) observed between consecutive pregnancy stages, analyzed **separately for SLE and Healthy** women.

Compared to the FDR0.01 subset, these results include additional but still statistically controlled transcriptional reductions.

## Academic interpretation

1. **Healthy pregnancies:** Exhibit very few downregulated genes, indicating continued **immune stability** throughout pregnancy.

2. **SLE pregnancies:** Show slightly more downregulated genes compared to FDR 0.01, but counts remain low — supporting the view that **transcriptional suppression is minimal** relative to upregulation.

3. **Complementary to UP sets:** While SLE shows occasional reductions, the imbalance toward upregulation remains, revealing **sustained immune activation** and **limited compensatory regulation**.

4. **Stage-specific observations:** The postpartum transition (PP vs 32–40w) often exhibits a few more downregulated genes, which may reflect partial immune recalibration after delivery.
