# Folder: `B_Temporal_adjacent/FDR0.05/UP/`

### Upregulated genes within each condition at **FDR < 0.05** and **logFC > 1**

This folder contains the **expanded set of temporally upregulated genes** (twofold or greater increases) between consecutive pregnancy stages, analyzed **separately for SLE and Healthy** women.

Compared to the FDR0.01 subset, these results include additional but still statistically controlled changes (5% FDR).

## Interpretation

1. **Healthy stability vs SLE activity:** Healthy pregnancies again show few temporal increases, indicating a largely **homeostatic immune environment**, whereas SLE displays modest yet persistent transcriptional activation across stages.

2. **Extended view of temporal modulation:** The FDR 0.05 cutoff captures additional interferon-related and cytokine genes that were below significance at 1%, showing that **immune activation fluctuates more broadly over time** in SLE.

3. **Dynamic but not transient:** Although some upregulated genes differ by stage, the underlying biological theme — interferon signaling and antiviral defense — remains constant, confirming **chronic immune sensitization** rather than brief flares.

4. **Pregnancy-to-postpartum transitions:** Upregulation near the postpartum period (PP vs 32–40w) is especially interesting, suggesting **post-delivery immune rebound** or inflammation persistence in SLE but not in Healthy women.
