# Purpose of this Folder

Here I have split all the work I did into analytical tasks. Each task represents a step in the progression of the analysis, and it is marked by a folder in this directory. 
Each folder is related to one major task completed during that phase, and it contains sub-folders with:
  - Input files
  - Code files
  - Output files
  - Graphs
