!Series_summary	"Systemic lupus erythematosus carries increased risk of pregnancy complications.  To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we characterized the blood transcriptome of lupus patients and healthy controls during pregnancy and postpartum and performed multicolor flow-cytometry in a subset. We also followed healthy women undergoing assisted reproductive technology, allowing for analysis around embryo implantation. A striking and sustained down modulation of two lupus-related signatures, interferon and plasma cells, takes place during healthy pregnancy. These changes appear immediately post embryo implantation and are mirrored in uncomplicated lupus pregnancies. Patients with preeclampsia displayed early upregulation of neutrophil signatures and expansion of immature neutrophils. Lupus pregnancies with fetal complications carried the highest interferon and plasma cell signatures as well as ICOS+ CD4+ T cell counts. Thus, healthy and uncomplicated lupus pregnancies exhibit early and sustained transcriptional modulation of lupus-related signatures, and failure to do so is associated with adverse outcomes."
